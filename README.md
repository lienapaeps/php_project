- Every time you finish a feature (marked done in Trello), make a pull request on the main project.

- Use [BEM css standards](https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/).
- Use the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework for page layout.
- Use [Fontawesome v5](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search?s=duotone) for icons.
- We work mobile first, using following breakpoints (from Bootstrap):

| Small | Medium | Large | X-Large | XX-Large |
